# MongoDB_backend_CRUD
This is an example of back end CRUD functionality using async functions to demonstrate all functions step by step. This uses MongoDB and NodeJS and contains no from end forms. 3 Collections exist on MongoDB, one for customers, one for phones, and one for purchases. Customers purchase phones from the phone shop and a record is kept of their purchases. A user must only run the NodeJS file in their chosen IDE and the log will describe what is happening step by step. Full CRUD is carried out on each collection.
